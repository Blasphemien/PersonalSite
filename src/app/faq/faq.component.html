        <h3>What are your payment options?</h3>
        <p>I am quite flexible with payment arrangements. Generally, to make it easier, I suggest payments on a 'per project' basis rather than 'by the hour'. 15% deposit at the commence of the project and the remaining 85% at project completion.</p>
        <p>If this dosen't suit you I am happy to discuss an alternative.</p>

        <h3>Can I add changes to the requirements of the project once the contract has been signed?</h3>
